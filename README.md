# Weather-App-The weather app is designed to provide users with up-to-date weather information for a specific location. The app consists of a simple and responsive user interface.

The HTML structure begins with a container div that holds the app's content. Inside the container, there is an h1 heading displaying the title of the app, followed by a weather-card div. The weather-card represents the main area where weather information will be displayed. Within the weather-card, there is an h2 element with a class of "location" to show the location name.The JavaScript code is responsible for fetching weather data from an external API and updating the HTML elements with the retrieved data. It uses the fetch API to make an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the desired location and an API key. Once the response is received, the JSON data is extracted and used to update the HTML elements dynamically.
